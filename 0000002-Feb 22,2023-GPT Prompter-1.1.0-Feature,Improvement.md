# Optimized Built-in Prompts
We've optimized prompts in the current chat modes by implementing megaprompts following the RTSC (Role-Task-Steps-Context) format. This enhancement brings two significant benefits:
- Improved AI responses.
- Optimized AI token usage.

# The Ultimate Prompt Engineering
We've introduced new chat mode "chatGPT prompt generator" to help you generate smart chatGPT prompts to make your conversations even better!
